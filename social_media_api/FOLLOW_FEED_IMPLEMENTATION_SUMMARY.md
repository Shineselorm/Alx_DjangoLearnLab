# Follow and Feed Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented User Follow and Feed functionality for the Social Media API, allowing users to follow other users and view an aggregated feed of posts from users they follow.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. User Model (Already Existed)

**File:** `accounts/models.py`

**Followers Field:**
```python
followers = models.ManyToManyField(
    'self',
    symmetrical=False,
    related_name='following',
    blank=True
)
```

**Helper Methods:**
- `follow(user)` - Follow another user
- `unfollow(user)` - Unfollow a user
- `is_following(user)` - Check if following
- `is_followed_by(user)` - Check if followed by
- `get_follower_count()` - Count followers
- `get_following_count()` - Count following

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already implemented, no changes needed

---

### 2. New Follow Endpoints

**File:** `accounts/views.py`

#### FollowUserByIdView (NEW)
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/accounts/follow/<user_id>/`

**Features:**
- Follow specific user by ID
- Validates against self-follow
- Returns user info and follow status

**Lines:** 263-294

#### UnfollowUserByIdView (NEW)
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/accounts/unfollow/<user_id>/`

**Features:**
- Unfollow specific user by ID
- Validates against self-unfollow
- Returns user info and follow status

**Lines:** 297-329

**Status:** ‚úÖ Newly implemented

---

### 3. Feed Functionality

**File:** `posts/views.py`

#### FeedView (NEW)
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/feed/`

**Features:**
- Shows posts from followed users only
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)
- Paginated (10 posts per page)
- Includes following count in response
- Optimized queries with select_related/prefetch_related
- Handles empty state (no follows or no posts)

**Query:**
```python
Post.objects.filter(
    author__in=following_users
).select_related('author').prefetch_related('comments').order_by('-created_at')
```

**Lines:** 186-237

**Status:** ‚úÖ Newly implemented

---

### 4. URL Configuration

#### accounts/urls.py (UPDATED)

**Added Routes:**
```python
path('follow/<int:user_id>/', views.FollowUserByIdView.as_view(), name='follow-user'),
path('unfollow/<int:user_id>/', views.UnfollowUserByIdView.as_view(), name='unfollow-user'),
```

**Existing Routes (Already Implemented):**
- `follow/` - Generic follow/unfollow endpoint
- `followers/` - Get followers list
- `following/` - Get following list

#### posts/urls.py (UPDATED)

**Added Route:**
```python
path('feed/', FeedView.as_view(), name='feed'),
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ URLs configured

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### Follow System
- ‚úÖ Follow users by ID
- ‚úÖ Unfollow users by ID
- ‚úÖ View followers list (paginated)
- ‚úÖ View following list (paginated)
- ‚úÖ Prevent self-following
- ‚úÖ Generic follow/unfollow endpoint
- ‚úÖ Follower/following counts
- ‚úÖ Follow status checking

### Feed System
- ‚úÖ Personalized feed based on following
- ‚úÖ Chronological order (newest first)
- ‚úÖ Only shows posts from followed users
- ‚úÖ Pagination (10 posts per page)
- ‚úÖ Following count in response
- ‚úÖ Empty state handling
- ‚úÖ Optimized database queries
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization with select_related/prefetch_related

---

## üîí Security Features

1. **Authentication Required:**
   - All endpoints require token authentication
   - Anonymous users cannot access

2. **Permission Checks:**
   - Users can only modify their own following list
   - Cannot follow yourself
   - Cannot unfollow yourself

3. **Validation:**
   - User existence validation
   - Self-follow prevention
   - Proper error messages

---

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Feed Query Optimization

```python
# Efficient query with minimal database hits
Post.objects.filter(
    author__in=following_users
).select_related('author').prefetch_related('comments').order_by('-created_at')
```

**Optimizations:**
1. **select_related('author')** - Single JOIN for author data
2. **prefetch_related('comments')** - Efficient comment loading
3. **author__in** - Single query for all followed users' posts
4. **order_by('-created_at')** - Database-level sorting
5. **Pagination** - Limits data transfer

### Database Indexes

Existing indexes from Post model:
- Index on `created_at` field
- Index on `author` field

These optimize feed queries for performance.
