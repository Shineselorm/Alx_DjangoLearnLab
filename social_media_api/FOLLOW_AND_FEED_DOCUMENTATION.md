## User Model Updates

### CustomUser Model Fields

The CustomUser model includes a `followers` field for managing follow relationships.

**File:** `accounts/models.py`

```python
followers = models.ManyToManyField(
    'self',
    symmetrical=False,
    related_name='following',
    blank=True,
    help_text='Users who follow this user'
)
```

### Model Relationships

- **`user.followers`** - QuerySet of users who follow this user
- **`user.following`** - QuerySet of users this user follows

### Helper Methods

```python
# Follow a user
user.follow(other_user)

# Unfollow a user
user.unfollow(other_user)

# Check if following
user.is_following(other_user)  # Returns boolean

# Check if followed by
user.is_followed_by(other_user)  # Returns boolean

# Get counts
user.get_follower_count()  # Number of followers
user.get_following_count()  # Number of users following
```

### Feed Features

- **Personalized Feed**: Only shows posts from users you follow
- **Chronological Order**: Most recent posts first
- **Paginated**: 10 posts per page (default)
- **Following Count**: Includes count of users you follow
- **Optimized Queries**: Uses select_related and prefetch_related for performance

### Empty Feed Response

If you don't follow anyone or they haven't posted:

```json
{
    "count": 0,
    "following_count": 0,
    "results": []
}
```

  }'

# Follow user with ID 5
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/follow/5/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Result:**
```json

        return response.json()

# Usage
client = SocialMediaClient("your_token_here")

# Follow a user

print(f"âœ… {result['message']}")

# Get feed
feed = client.get_feed()
print(f"ðŸ“° Feed has {feed['count']} posts from {feed['following_count']} users")

# Display feed posts
for post in feed['results']:
    author = post['author']['username']
    title = post['title']
    print(f"  - {title} by @{author}")

# Get following list
following = client.get_following()
print(f"ðŸ‘¥ Following {following['count']} users")
```

## Features Summary

### Follow System
âœ… Follow users by ID  
âœ… Unfollow users by ID  
âœ… View followers list  
âœ… View following list  
âœ… Prevent self-following  
âœ… Follower/following counts  
âœ… Paginated results  

### Feed System
âœ… Personalized feed based on following  
âœ… Chronological order (newest first)  
âœ… Optimized database queries  
âœ… Paginated results (10 per page)  
âœ… Shows following count  
âœ… Empty state handling  

---

## Implementation Details

### Database Optimization

The feed uses optimized queries:
```python
Post.objects.filter(
    author__in=following_users
).select_related('author').prefetch_related('comments').order_by('-created_at')
```

**Optimizations:**
- `select_related('author')` - Reduces queries for author data
- `prefetch_related('comments')` - Efficient comment loading
- `order_by('-created_at')` - Newest posts first
- Uses `following.all()` which leverages database indexes

### Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only modify their own following list
- Cannot follow yourself
- Proper permission checks in place

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Empty Feed

**Possible Causes:**
1. Not following anyone
2. Followed users haven't created posts

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check who you're following
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/following/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"

# Follow some users
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/follow/5/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Issue: Cannot Follow User

**Error:** "You cannot follow yourself"

**Solution:** You're trying to follow your own account. Follow a different user.

---

## Performance Considerations

- Feed queries are optimized with select_related/prefetch_related
- Results are paginated to limit response size
- Database indexes on created_at field for efficient ordering
- Many-to-many relationship handled efficiently by Django ORM
