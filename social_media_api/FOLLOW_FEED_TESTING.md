# Follow and Feed - Quick Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to quickly test the Follow and Feed functionality.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Running:** Ensure the development server is running:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **User Accounts:** You need at least 2-3 user accounts to test follow functionality.

---

## Quick Test Workflow

### Step 1: Create Test Users

```bash
# Register User 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "password": "alice123",
    "password_confirm": "alice123",
    "bio": "Alice here!"
  }'

# Save the token from response
# TOKEN_ALICE="<token_here>"

# Register User 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "bob",
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "password": "bob123",
    "password_confirm": "bob123",
    "bio": "Bob here!"
  }'

# TOKEN_BOB="<token_here>"

# Register User 3
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "charlie",
    "email": "charlie@example.com",
    "password": "charlie123",
    "password_confirm": "charlie123",
    "bio": "Charlie here!"
  }'

# TOKEN_CHARLIE="<token_here>"
```

---

### Step 2: Create Posts (as Bob and Charlie)

```bash
# Bob creates a post
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/posts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_BOB" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Bob'\''s First Post",
    "content": "Hello from Bob! This is my first post."
  }'

# Charlie creates a post
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/posts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_CHARLIE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Charlie'\''s Adventure",
    "content": "Just went hiking today! Amazing views."
  }'

# Bob creates another post
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/posts/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_BOB" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Bob'\''s Second Post",
    "content": "Update: Working on a new project!"
  }'
```

---

### Step 3: Get User IDs

```bash
# List all users to get their IDs
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/users/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "alice",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "username": "bob",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "username": "charlie",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Note Bob's ID (e.g., 2) and Charlie's ID (e.g., 3).

---

### Step 4: Alice Follows Bob and Charlie

```bash
# Alice follows Bob (user ID 2)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/follow/2/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"

# Expected: {"message": "You are now following bob", "following": true, ...}

# Alice follows Charlie (user ID 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/follow/3/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"

# Expected: {"message": "You are now following charlie", "following": true, ...}
```

---

### Step 5: Check Who Alice is Following

```bash
# Get Alice's following list
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/following/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "username": "bob",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "username": "charlie",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 6: View Alice's Feed

```bash
# Get Alice's personalized feed
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/feed/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "following_count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "author": {
        "id": 2,
        "username": "bob",
        ...
      },
      "title": "Bob's Second Post",
      "content": "Update: Working on a new project!",
      "created_at": "2025-10-11T12:30:00Z",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "author": {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "charlie",
        ...
      },
      "title": "Charlie's Adventure",
      "content": "Just went hiking today! Amazing views.",
      "created_at": "2025-10-11T12:15:00Z",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "author": {
        "id": 2,
        "username": "bob",
        ...
      },
      "title": "Bob's First Post",
      "content": "Hello from Bob! This is my first post.",
      "created_at": "2025-10-11T12:00:00Z",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ Feed shows only posts from Bob and Charlie (users Alice follows)**  
**‚úÖ Posts are ordered by creation date (newest first)**

---

### Step 7: Test Empty Feed

```bash
# Bob's feed (Bob doesn't follow anyone yet)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/feed/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_BOB"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 0,
  "following_count": 0,
  "results": []
}
```

**‚úÖ Empty feed when not following anyone**

---

### Step 8: Test Unfollow

```bash
# Alice unfollows Charlie (user ID 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/unfollow/3/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"

# Expected: {"message": "You have unfollowed charlie", "following": false, ...}

# Check Alice's feed again
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/feed/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"
```

**Expected:**  
‚úÖ Feed now shows only Bob's posts (not Charlie's)

---

### Step 9: Test Self-Follow Prevention

```bash
# Try to follow yourself
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/follow/1/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "You cannot follow yourself."
}
```

**‚úÖ Self-follow is prevented**

---

### Step 10: Test Followers List

```bash
# Check Bob's followers (should include Alice)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/followers/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_BOB"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "alice",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ Bob's followers list shows Alice**

## Test Checklist

Use this checklist to verify all functionality:

### Follow/Unfollow
- [ ] Can follow a user by ID
- [ ] Can unfollow a user by ID
- [ ] Cannot follow yourself (error message)
- [ ] Following list shows correct users
- [ ] Followers list shows correct users
- [ ] Following count is accurate

### Feed
- [ ] Feed shows only posts from followed users
- [ ] Posts are in chronological order (newest first)
- [ ] Feed updates when following new users
- [ ] Feed updates when unfollowing users
- [ ] Empty feed when not following anyone
- [ ] Feed includes following_count
- [ ] Feed pagination works (if > 10 posts)

### Security
- [ ] All endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Unauthenticated requests are rejected
- [ ] Users can only modify their own following list

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Empty Feed Despite Following Users

**Problem:** Feed is empty even though you follow users.

**Solution:**
- Check that the followed users have created posts
- Verify following list: `GET /api/accounts/following/`
- Check all posts: `GET /api/posts/`

### Issue 2: 401 Unauthorized

**Problem:** Getting "Authentication credentials were not provided"

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're including the token header
- Format: `Authorization: Token <your_token>`
- Check token is valid (login again if needed)

### Issue 3: Feed Shows All Posts

**Problem:** Feed shows posts from users you don't follow

**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen. Check the implementation
- Verify you're using `/api/feed/` not `/api/posts/`

---

## Performance Testing

To test feed performance with many posts:

```python
# Create many posts (run in Django shell)
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from posts.models import Post

User = get_user_model()
user = User.objects.get(username='bob')

# Create 100 posts
for i in range(100):
    Post.objects.create(
        author=user,
        title=f"Test Post {i}",
        content=f"This is test post number {i}"
    )

print("Created 100 posts")
```

Then check feed pagination:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/feed/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN_ALICE"
```

**‚úÖ Should return 10 posts per page with pagination links**

---

## Verification Summary

After completing all tests, you should have verified:

1. ‚úÖ Users can follow other users by ID
2. ‚úÖ Users can unfollow other users by ID
3. ‚úÖ Self-follow is prevented
4. ‚úÖ Feed shows only posts from followed users
5. ‚úÖ Feed is chronologically ordered (newest first)
6. ‚úÖ Empty feed when not following anyone
7. ‚úÖ Following/followers lists are accurate
8. ‚úÖ Pagination works correctly
9. ‚úÖ Authentication is required for all endpoints
10. ‚úÖ Unfollowing removes posts from feed
