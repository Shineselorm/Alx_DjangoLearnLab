## Overview

Successfully implemented complete Posts and Comments functionality for the Social Media API, including all CRUD operations, permissions, filtering, pagination, and comprehensive documentation.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Posts App ✅
- **Directory:** `posts/`
- **Files Created:**
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `apps.py` - App configuration
  - `models.py` - Post and Comment models
  - `views.py` - Viewsets for CRUD operations
  - `serializers.py` - Data serialization
  - `urls.py` - URL routing
  - `admin.py` - Admin interface configuration
  - `migrations/0001_initial.py` - Database migration

### 2. Created Models ✅

#### Post Model
**File:** `posts/models.py`

**Fields:**
- `author` - ForeignKey to User (CASCADE)
- `title` - CharField (max 200 chars)
- `content` - TextField
- `created_at` - DateTimeField (auto_now_add)
- `updated_at` - DateTimeField (auto_now)

**Features:**
- Indexes on created_at and author for performance
- Related name 'posts' for reverse lookups
- Helper method `get_comment_count()`
- Ordered by `-created_at` (most recent first)

#### Comment Model
**File:** `posts/models.py`

**Fields:**
- `post` - ForeignKey to Post (CASCADE)
- `author` - ForeignKey to User (CASCADE)
- `content` - TextField
- `created_at` - DateTimeField (auto_now_add)
- `updated_at` - DateTimeField (auto_now)

**Features:**
- Indexes on post/created_at and author
- Related name 'comments' for reverse lookups
- Ordered by `created_at` (chronological)

### 3. Created Serializers ✅

**File:** `posts/serializers.py`

**Serializers Implemented:**
1. **AuthorSerializer** - For displaying author info
2. **PostSerializer** - Full post serialization with comments
3. **PostListSerializer** - Simplified for list views (performance)
4. **CommentSerializer** - Comment serialization

**Features:**
- Automatic author assignment from request.user
- Content validation (non-empty, length limits)
- Nested serialization for related objects
- Read-only fields for timestamps and computed fields

### 4. Implemented Viewsets ✅

**File:** `posts/views.py`

#### PostViewSet
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/posts/` - List all posts
- `POST /api/posts/` - Create post
- `GET /api/posts/{id}/` - Retrieve post
- `PUT/PATCH /api/posts/{id}/` - Update post (author only)
- `DELETE /api/posts/{id}/` - Delete post (author only)
- `GET /api/posts/{id}/comments/` - Get post comments
- `GET /api/posts/my_posts/` - Get user's posts

**Features:**
- Permission: `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` + `IsAuthorOrReadOnly`
- Search by title/content/author
- Filter by author username
- Order by created_at, updated_at, title
- Optimized queries with select_related and prefetch_related

#### CommentViewSet
**Endpoints:**

### 5. Custom Permissions ✅

**File:** `posts/views.py`

**IsAuthorOrReadOnly:**
- Allows read access to everyone
- Allows write access only to object author
- Ensures users can only modify their own content

### 6. URL Configuration ✅

**File:** `posts/urls.py`

**Router Configuration:**
```python
router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'posts', PostViewSet, basename='post')
router.register(r'comments', CommentViewSet, basename='comment')
```

**Main URLs Updated:**
- Added `path('api/', include('posts.urls'))` to main urls.py

**Result URLs:**
- `/api/posts/` - Posts endpoints
- `/api/comments/` - Comments endpoints

### 7. Pagination and Filtering ✅

**Pagination:**
- Already configured in settings.py
- Page size: 10 items per page
- Uses `PageNumberPagination`

- Custom filters: by author, by post
- Ordering: by created_at, updated_at

### 8. Admin Interface ✅

**File:** `posts/admin.py`

- Search functionality
- Filters by date and author
- Organized fieldsets
- Helper displays (comment count, content preview)
